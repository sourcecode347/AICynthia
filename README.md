# Info

I said to open the source of AI because I've moved away from Windows 11 originally planned and generally don't want to support closed source operating systems like Windows and Android anymore, so I'll upgrade the code when the time comes for an Open Source OS and Development Boards that it will take place better there and those who want to participate in the Project are welcome.

If you want to upgrade the code, it has a large Array with many Greek quotes and philosophies that was written for me by a machine in the code, slowly I did not sit down to write it myself, this reason makes the file large and requires a powerful system and Ram in a text editor, it is like to open a huge Wordlist and have everything crash.

The solution is to put the Array on a Server with a Server Side Language like PHP and for the AI to send POST & READ requests and return them as a result, so as to lighten the file and run it in text writers to process it as it should.
